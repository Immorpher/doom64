		<h1>Engines</h1>
		
			<p>The Doom 64 engine built upon the PlayStation Doom engine which itself was derived from the Atari Jaguar Doom engine. It utilized the Nintendo 64's 3D acceleration capabilities, thus it is a hardware-rendered version of the engine. The Doom 64 source code has never been officially released, thus various engines based on reverse engineering and adaptations to other engines have been made. Linked below is a list keeping track of many of them.</p>

			</ul>
			
			<p>Given Doom 64's unique aesthetics, it has inspired many gameplay mods to give classic Doom its style. The following list links many such mods.</p>

			<p>Although the source code for Doom 64 was never released publicly, the community would eventually completely reverse engineer the game. With the exception of the official Doom 64 Remaster, all of the Doom 64 engines which natively support its level format are open-sourced and are able to be modified. Doom 64 engines are in two main branches: PC compatible ports and Nintendo 64 compatible ports.</p>
			
		<h2>PC Engines</h2>
		
			<p>Although adaptations of Doom 64 to other Doom engines existed prior, Doom 64 EX was the first engine to use partially reverse-engineered Doom 64 code. It natively supported the Doom 64 map format, which allowed the game to be played with decent accuracy. This has been used as a base for other PC engines including the official Doom 64 Remaster and modern console ports.</p>

		<h2>N64 Engines</h2>
		
			<p>The Doom 64 source code was not fully reverse-engineered until 2020, when Doom 64 RE was released. This release allowed Doom 64 mods to be made for Nintendo 64 hardware (and emulators). It is compiled with the original Nintendo 64 SDK. Many later forks of this engine have been updated to run on the Modern N64 SDK, which has the latest compiler updates.</p>

			<p>By updating the source code of these engines, you can create Nintendo 64 hardware compatible mods and games. The guide below can get you started with Nintendo 64 compiling.</p>

		<h2>Passwords</h2>
		
			<p>Originally Doom 64 implemented password system for those who did not own a Nintendo 64 memory pack. Currently the Nintendo 64 engines, many PC engines, and even some adaptations still support the original Doom 64 passwords. The page below contains a generator to decode and encode passwords.</p>
