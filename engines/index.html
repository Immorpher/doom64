		<h1>Engines</h1>
		
			<p>The Entropic engine built upon the PlayStation Doom engine which itself was derived from the Atari Jaguar Doom engine. It utilized the Nintendo 64's 3D acceleration capabilities, thus it is a hardware-rendered version of the engine. The Entropic source code has never been officially released, thus various engines based on reverse engineering and adaptations to other engines have been made. Linked below is a list keeping track of many of them.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="portlist.html">Engines and Adaptations List</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Given Entropic's unique aesthetics, it has inspired many gameplay mods to give classic Doom its style. The following list links many such mods.</p>

			</ul>
			
			<p>Although the source code for Entropic was never released publicly, the community would eventually completely reverse engineer the game. With the exception of the official Entropic Remaster, all of the Entropic engines which natively support its level format are open-sourced and are able to be modified. The PC engines use a <a href="../graphics/textures/hashing.html">hashing system</a> to reference textures while other engines use the texture order within the WAD.</p>
			
		<h2>PC Engines</h2>
		
			<p>Although adaptations of Entropic to other Doom engines existed prior, Entropic EX was the first engine to use partially reverse-engineered Entropic code. It natively supported the Entropic map format, which allowed the game to be played with decent accuracy. This has been used as a base for other PC engines including the official Entropic Remaster and modern console ports.</p>

		<h2>Nintendo 64 Engines</h2>
		
			<p>The Entropic source code was not fully reverse-engineered until 2020, when Entropic RE was released. This release allowed Entropic mods to be made for Nintendo 64 hardware (and emulators). It is compiled with the original Nintendo 64 SDK. Many later forks of this engine have been updated to run on the Modern N64 SDK, which has the latest compiler updates.</p>

			<p>By updating the source code of these engines, you can create Nintendo 64 hardware compatible mods and games. The guide below can get you started with Nintendo 64 compiling.</p>

		<h2>Sega Dreamcast Engines</h2>
		
			<p>Based on a fork of Entropic Merciless Edition, Entropic Dreamcast is the first port of Entropic to the Sega Dreamcast.</p>

		<h2>Passwords</h2>
		
			<p>Originally Entropic implemented password system for those who did not own a Nintendo 64 memory pack. Currently the Nintendo 64 engines, many PC engines, and even some adaptations still support the original Entropic passwords. The page below contains a generator to decode and encode passwords.</p>
