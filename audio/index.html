		<h1>Audio</h1>
		
			<p>Doom 64's sound system was built upon the William's Entertainment Sound System (WESS) but adapted for the Nintendo 64 and went by the name of NESS (affectionately known as nessy). The engine ran at a sound quality of 22.05 kHz sample rate even though the sounds themselves were at 11.025 kHz sample rate. The Nintendo 64 interpreted those sounds at 22.05 kHz, thus the raw sounds play back at double the original sample rate. In-engine, however, the sounds were down-pitched by half via nearest-neighbor interpolation to restore their original pitch. For the official Doom 64 Remaster, the 11.05 kHz sounds were upscaled to 22.05 kHz using an interpolation method, and play back at 48 kHz. Unlike other id Tech engine games of the time, the Doom 64 sounds are 16 bit rather than 8 bit. The audio assets page below lists the sounds used in the original Doom 64.</p>

		<h2>Music</h2>
		
			<p>For the most part, Nintendo 64 games were MIDI driven. But they did not use the General MIDI soundset definitions, rather any set of sounds the developer wanted could be used. This MIDI structure is very much alive in Doom 64 engines to this day. The guide below describes how to use and make custom music for the variety of Doom 64 engines.</p>

		<h2>Sounds</h2>
		
			<p>For the Nintendo 64 and Doom 64 Engines, the sound and music assets are stored together in a soundbank. However for the Doom 64 Remaster, the in-game sounds are separated into the main WAD. The guide below describes how to replace the existing game sounds with custom ones.</p>
