		<h1>Sectors</h1>
		
		<p>Sectors are a group of lines that define an area. Thus the majority of time sectors are enclosed geometric shapes, which can be connected to other shapes. It is not a strict requirement that sectors are closed, however when they are not closed it can result in graphical glitches. Sectors define the moveable area, lighting, room sizes, and floor/ceiling textures. Additional sector properties can be assigned via flags and specials as defined in the subsequent sections.</p>
		
		<h2>Lighting</h2>
		
			<p>Doom 64 is known for its gradient colored lighting, where you can control the color of the ceiling, floors, walls, and even sprites individually and dynamically. This can cause gradients along the walls to simulate light sources and ambient occlusion.</p>
			
			<p>Each sector has five hexadecimal values which define the lighting of the sector: ceiling, top half wall, thing, bottom half wall, and floor. The top half wall and bottom half wall will blend in a gradient along walls. For upper linedefs, there is a flag to flip the gradient direction. Sprites, objects, and things can be colored separately from the walls, floors, and ceilings. This can shade textures specific colors without affecting sprites like a light would.</p>
	
		<h2>Sector Flags</h2>
		
			<p>Sector flags are settings and properties you can apply to sectors. These tend to affect textures, sounds, and the player. In contrast, sector specials determine lighting effects and instant death for crushers.</p>

			<h3>Sequenced Lights (205)</h3>
			
			<p>Sequenced lights are used in Staging Area, Altar of Pain, and other levels of the original Doom 64 campaign. These are the "rotating" glowing light effects that appear to travel along sectors. To construct this light sequence, the first sector is an tagged sector with one of the light specials (glowing/strobing/flickering). The next adjoining sector is a sector with the same tag and the 205 Sequence Starter special; this is the start of the light sequence. The subsequent adjoining sectors have incrementally increasing tags (no specials required) where the effect propigates into. All of the double sided linedefs should be pointing towards the sector with the light special. After 16 sectors (including the sequence starter), the effect repeats. See this <a href="sectors\sequencedlights.wad">example WAD</a> to see it in action.</p>
