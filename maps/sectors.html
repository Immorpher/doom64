		<h1>Sectors</h1>
		
			<p>Sectors are a group of lines that define an area. Thus the majority of time sectors are enclosed geometric shapes, which can be connected to other shapes. It is not a strict requirement that sectors are closed, however when they are not closed it can result in graphical glitches. Sectors define the moveable area, lighting, room sizes, and floor/ceiling textures. Additional sector properties can be assigned via flags and specials as defined in the subsequent sections. On the original engine, the minimum number of sectors is 2, while the maximum number of sectors is 32,767 (although blockmap and sidedef limits tend to be reached first).</p>

			<p>Sector flags are settings and properties you can apply to sectors. These tend to affect textures, sounds, and the player. In contrast, sector specials determine lighting effects and instant death for crushers.</p>

		<h2 id="Lighting">Lighting</h2>
		
			<p>Sectors define the lighting of Doom 64 in two styles. Each sector has five color values which define the gradient lighting of the sector: ceiling, top half wall, thing, bottom half wall, and floor. Then via the sector special value, additive lighting is defined. The following page describes the sector lighting in more detail.</p>
