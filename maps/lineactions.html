		<h1>Line Actions</h1>
		
		<p>Line actions are specific events and actions that can be assigned to lines. These actions can be set to be activated in various ways such as crossing, shooting, the use button, or another type of trigger. Additionally monsters will be able to activate linedefs they cross if those linedefs have the "Trigger By Dead Thing" flag; this does not work on the original Doom 64 EX.</p>
