		<h1>Actions</h1>
		
		<p>Doom 64 has various actions which cause levels to transform, doors to operate, lights to change, and other events. These actions can be assigned to linedefs and activated in many ways such as crossing, shooting, the use button, or another type of trigger. Monsters will be able to activate most linedefs they cross if those linedefs have the "Trigger By Dead Thing" flag (this does not work on the original Doom 64 EX). If you are using linedefs to trigger actions, they will appear yellow on the player's automap. To hide this, you can check the "secret" box on the lindef properties and they will appear as a normal linedef. This can also be a good way to hide secret doors.</p>
		
		<p>Additionally, macros are used to execute a multiple actions with just a single linedef activation. The actions can happen all at once or delays can be added between them to create a sequence. Only one macro can be run at a time within the engine - all other macros will be blocked until the current macro is finished. Initially not all macro actions were understood, so the names in which the compiler has refered to them has changed over time. For convenience of looking at older macros, additional names are included.
		
		<p>The majority of actions target a specific line, sector, or thing with a specified <i>tag</i>. Additional properties are sometimes assigned via action 204, which sets the global integer / macro integer. Macros which have two inputs are, in reality, a combination of actions where action 204 happens first, followed by another action for the specific effect.</p>
		
		<p>Whichever linedef is tagged 999 will be activated upon map startup. Thus any action or associated macro this linedef points to will execute. This is how the intro sequence for Doom 64 is activated right from the start which happens on map33.</p>
		
		<p>Many of the actions are labeled as "(undefined)" when they are not specifically defined for use in Doom Builder 64, but they can still be used. For linedefs, you just need to type in the corresponding number of an undefined action to use it. For macros, at the top of the script, you will use the "#define" property, followed by the name you want to use as the macro, then the macro number and its value. For example this is how the simple door open action is defined: "#define Door_Open(tag) 2:tag".</p>
		
		<p>There are some limits to moving sectors. Only one height-changing action can operate on a single sector at the same time. Therefore, it is recommended to use the <i>wait</i> action before doing another action on the same sector if using a macro. Further, the Doom 64 Remaster canâ€™t have more than 30 moving ceilings and floors at the same time while EX based ports can have more.</p>

		<h2>Doors</h2>
			<p>Some doors can be opened by monsters by default, and the others can still be opened by monsters if "Trigger By Dead Thing" tag is set on the linedef.</p>

		<h2>Ceilings</h2>
			<p>Any sector that is set to an action that can crush will instantly kill anything in sectors with special 666. Once a ceiling is activated as a crusher, it will no longer respond to other ceiling actions even if stopped; it can only be restarted as a crusher. There is an upper limit to the number of crushers in Doom 64, however the EX versions have a higher upper limit.</p>

			<p>The light <i>id</i>, as opposed to the tag, refers to a specific light index. The first set of lights (0 to 255) are grayscale from black to white. The subsequent light indices refer directly to the lights lump, that is built in the map WAD, where the first light begins at 256. It can be hard to tell which light you are referring to just in a map editor, however you can look at the lights lump in a program like <a href="https://slade.mancubus.net/">Slade</a> to determine which lights are in which order.</p>

			<p>When controlling macros the <i>id</i> does not refer to the macro number itself but how it is referenced to in linedef actions, where 255 is added to the macro number. Thus the <i>id</i> for macro 1 would be 256. For linedef actions the <i>id</i> is set by the line <i>tag</i>.</p>
			
		<h3>Looping Specifics</h3>
		<p>Actions can be looped within a macro with action 246. It will loop back to the line of actions where it started, thus it is recommended to use wait or delay actions to set new lines. A looping macro can be canceled early by line action 248: Macro Suspend. Below is an example of how a loop is formatted.</p>
<pre>macro 1
{
  non looping action;
  delay(0);
  loop(<i>times</i>)
  {
	  <i>action to loop;</i>
	  <i>action to loop;</i>

			</tbody></table>

			<p>When using action 243 (Camera Move) it will move around the <i>thing</i> used for the target, as if the thing itself was a camera. That means using a key as a target, the key will end up where the camera stops at the very end. However if the moved thing collides with its prior position it will crash the game; which is a potential problem for players and monsters. When the camera is set to a monster, the camera's height will be at the bottom of the monster. For flying monsters this is not an issue, however for other monsters it can partially clip through the floor.</p>
