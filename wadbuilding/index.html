		<h1>WAD Building</h1>
		
			<p>WAD files are where the majority of the Doom 64 assets are stored, which includes the graphics and levels. The music and sound file locations vary from engine to engine. See the <a href="../audio/index.html">audio section</a> for more information on how to handle audio assets.</p>
		
		<h2>PC Engines</h2>
			
			<p>For the PC Engines, WADs can be made and opened with any Doom WAD editor, and the file structure is very similar to the other Doom games. Here asset types are stored in lumps designated by markers, and each map is in its own lump. For Doom 64, maps can also be stored in WADs and placed into the main WAD. One of the more popular WAD editors for this is Slade.</p>

		<h3>Sound Lumps</h3>
		
			<p>For Doom 64 EX, EX+, and Super EX+ no sound assets except for the music MIDI files are stored in the WAD. Instead all sound assets are stored in soundfonts. Then for the Doom 64 Remaster, the in-game sound effects are stored in the WAD but the music sounds are still stored in a soundfont.</p>
			
		<h3>Text Lumps</h3>
		
			<p>Text lumps were introduced by Doom 64 EX to define texture animations (ANIMDEFS), map properties (MAPINFO), and sky effect properties (SKYDEFS). These have been utilized in all other PC engines of Doom 64. The pages below define which properties can be used.</p>

				<li><a href="mapinfo.html">MAPINFO Lump</a></li>
				<li><a href="skydefs.html">SKYDEFS Lump</a></li>
			</ul>
			
		<h2>Nintendo 64</h2>
		
			<p>The Doom 64 engines for the Nintendo 64 come with a utility to rip a WAD from the Doom 64 ROM. Although general Doom WAD editors can open up this WAD, they cannot view and properly save the assets. This is because these assets are compressed to save space and are padded for Nintendo 64 loading purposes (must to be divisible by two bytes). To decompress assets, you can either use Kovic's wadutil64, Nova's d64make, or Erick194's d64tool.</p>

				<li><a href="https://github.com/Erick194/D64TOOL/releases/">d64tool</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To rebuild these assets into a WAD, d64make or Molecicco's Slade 64 can be used.</p>

			<p>Interestingly the Doom 64 engines can load uncompressed assets. So it is not required to recompress the assets. However most flashcarts can't load N64 ROMs above 64 MB, so it may be helpful to recompress the assets. Erick194's d64tool can do this recompression; it can reduce the WAD size by nearly a half of its original size.</p>
