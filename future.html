			<li>Atomic Frog / Immorpher - Is "Switch Check Height" ignored on N64? Can the first switch in Breakdown be activated with chainsaw?</li>

			<li>Sector666 - "Accidentally putting two macros with the same number twice in a row (for example a macro 3 followed another macro 3) won't cause an error, but only the last macro with the same number will be used. It's as if the previous macro with the same number didn't exist</li>
			<li>Sector666 - Linedef action list</li>
			<li>agony ZENITH - Void sector walls for vanishing things? View distance issue.</li>
